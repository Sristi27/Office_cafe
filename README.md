## What's next for Office Cafe 
We are planning to add Google Authentication in order to make this more secure and helpful for all users.Also,the admin side is being developed currently and will soon be live.Cafeteria food hub owners can accept/reject offers and send out a confirmation regarding the same.

We have a lot of new features in mind to add to Office Cafe and scale it higher.
